# Couch_to_Coder

Welcome to the couch to coder repository from the Couch to Coder program by the Bright Network's Technology Academy! In this class, I learned various fundamental concepts and gained hands-on experience with Python programming and data analysis.

## Course Highlights

- **Python Mastery**: I gained a strong understanding of Python, including conditional flows, advanced data structures (dictionaries, lists), looping statements, 3rd party packages, research techniques, functions, and basic data analysis.

- **Real-World Projects**: During this class, I had the opportunity to work on exciting projects, including:
  - The ATM control flow system, employee dataset analysis, Amazon book dataset analysis, and Volkswagen automobile dataset analysis.

- **Data Visualization**: I explored the power of data visualization using third-party packages like Pandas and Matplotlib, transforming raw data into insightful visual representations.

- **PDF Parsing**: One of the program's highlights was learning how to extract valuable information from PDF files using Python, opening up new possibilities for data analysis.

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to:

- **Bright Network**: Thank you for providing the incredible Couch to Coder program and the opportunity to learn and grow in the world of technology.

- **Zsolt Prodoba-Szalai**: My amazing tutor, Zsolt, made learning Python enjoyable and accessible. His guidance and support were invaluable throughout this class.

## Future Steps

I am excited about the skills I've gained in this class and look forward to applying them to real-world challenges. The possibilities in coding and data analysis are endless, and I can't wait to explore them further.

Feel free to explore this repository to see my class projects and the code I've written during this exciting journey. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for joining me on this learning adventure!
