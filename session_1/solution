# Pseudo code

# Create a variable called balance with an int value representing the money in the user's account
# Create a variable called pin with an int value (for example 1234)
# Prompt the user to enter their pin !
# If the pin values match, display their balance.
# If they don't match, print out a message notifying the user
# Extensions:
# If the pin matches, give the prompt to the user if they'd like to withdraw or deposit some money.
# Once they made their choice, prompt them to enter an amount.
# Subtract or add the value to their account balance, then display the updated balance!


balance = 10000
pin = 1234
